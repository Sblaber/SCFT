AndersonMixing.py: I run this code interactively using ipython in python 3. It requires numpy and matplotlib. 
With current parameters it solves the SCFT of a wormlike polymer brush with Anderson mixing. 
It takes about 2 minutes to run 40 mixing steps and converge on my laptop.
The figure it plots at the end has the brush density in black solid line and the strong-stretching theory result as red dotted line.
